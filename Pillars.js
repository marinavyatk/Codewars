// Pillars
// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:
// number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
// distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
   const commonDistance = numPill*width+((numPill-1)*dist*100);
   if(numPill === 1){
     return commonDistance-width;
   }
   else{
     return commonDistance-2*width;
    }
}
